# BPetty.tech

This is a blog about security and networking. I started it as a way to hold myself accountable and chronicle my little journey down the rabbithole of #100DaysOfHomelab. Despite that (narrow) focus, it is entirely probable that I will begin posting other sorts of blog entries as well, especially if they do relate to security or networking. It would not be surprising to find posts on development and coding as well.

This project was created via the [**Chirpy Starter**](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) template on GitHub. By far the easiest way to set up a Jekyll site with a dark mode and automation.

As this is a new project, there are tons of things to do, still.
- [x] Update the About page to be...well...about me
- [x] Add (after creating) a favicon
- [ ] Contemplate other categories to add beyond #100DaysOfHomelab
- [ ] Earnestly contemplate my navel
- [ ] Switch hosting to in-house self-service
- [x] Stare blankly at the wall
