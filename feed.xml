I’m out of training, and that’s great, I really love what I do (entry-level IAM Engineer), and it’s certianly interesting! Unfortunately, as the learning curve is pretty steep, it leaves me a bit “brain dead” at the end of the day. Totally worth it! Also, totally a buzzkill for the whole #100DaysofHomeLab challenge. Still, I’m no... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>100DaysOfHomelab 19/100 - Dropping Containers, Building Machines</title><link href="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomeLab-Day19-Dropping-Containers-Building-Machines/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="100DaysOfHomelab 19/100 - Dropping Containers, Building Machines" /><published>2022-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-10-05T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomeLab-Day19-Dropping-Containers-Building-Machines/</id> <content src="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomeLab-Day19-Dropping-Containers-Building-Machines/" /> <author> <name>Brian Petty</name> </author> <category term="100DaysOfHomelab" /> <summary> I missed a day blogging, but I did work on my current project for about an hour yesterday. Still not going to count it, since I’m not sure. Basically, while Emby is pretty good, I really don’t like the subscription thing. And since I couldn’t get Jellyfin working in a container, like I wanted it to be (and will still work on from time-to-time) I decided to spin up a small Ubuntu VM in VirtualBo... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>100DaysOfHomelab 18/100 - Doing the Emby Shuffle</title><link href="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomeLab-Day18-Doing-the-Emby-Shuffle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="100DaysOfHomelab 18/100 - Doing the Emby Shuffle" /><published>2022-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-10-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomeLab-Day18-Doing-the-Emby-Shuffle/</id> <content src="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomeLab-Day18-Doing-the-Emby-Shuffle/" /> <author> <name>Brian Petty</name> </author> <category term="100DaysOfHomelab" /> <summary> Finally! So, I finally have a media server set up! I did drop Jellyfin (for now…it really looks like the best thing going if you don’t want a subscription) and switched to Emby. It was extraordinarily easy to set up…just copy the docker-config text from the page on Docker Hub. This is another image by linuxserver.io, and it runs great…just like everything from them that I’ve tried, other than J... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>100DaysOfHomelab 17/100 - Jellyfin Stings</title><link href="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomelab-Day17-Jellyfin-Stings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="100DaysOfHomelab 17/100 - Jellyfin Stings" /><published>2022-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-10-02T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomelab-Day17-Jellyfin-Stings/</id> <content src="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomelab-Day17-Jellyfin-Stings/" /> <author> <name>Brian Petty</name> </author> <category term="100DaysOfHomelab" /> <summary> So today, there is Jellyfin. Well, there is a container that has Jellyfin in it, but I can’t really access it. This is frustrating on several levels. The issue is permissions. I just deleted a long rant about linuxserver.io and their incomprehensible decision to utterly override user choice on permissions for the /config directory in the image. I tried a different image with another image (jell... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>100DaysOfHomelab 16/100 - Nuke It From Orbit</title><link href="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomelab-Day16-Nuke-It-From-Orbit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="100DaysOfHomelab 16/100 - Nuke It From Orbit" /><published>2022-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-10-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomelab-Day16-Nuke-It-From-Orbit/</id> <content src="https://bpetty.tech/posts/100DaysOfHomelab-Day16-Nuke-It-From-Orbit/" /> <author> <name>Brian Petty</name> </author> <category term="100DaysOfHomelab" /> <summary> Hello again! Maybe “Hello World” might be appropriate, here. As you can probably tell from the title, today’s exercise in futility with Docker finally got to the point where I tore it all down. I deleted all of the volumes, I deleted all of the images, and I even deleted everything out of my docker-compose file and started over. I am pleased to announce that as of now, almost everything is wor... </summary> </entry> </feed>
